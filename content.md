Everything should be data driven, if for example weapon has an abillity, I should be able to apply it onto another weapon.
If fitting, sound effects should be added for custom features of the features.

# Weapons
## Melee
### Conductpole
An iron spear, with normal durability, lower damage, but it chains its damage accross to X enemies, default is 5.
### Smasher
A netherite axe with lower durability and 30 damage, it is offset by having insanely long chargup rate, taking 20 seconds to charge up the attack (use attack speed for this)
### Bonker (rare)
A wooden axe. Stuns the oponents for 2 seconds on charged hits. Stun is simulated by slowness X.
### Royal Halberd (rare)
A diamond spear with 3 more damage than usual. It has slower attack speed and gives user speed I when holding it.
### Poisoned Dagger
A golden sword which applies 5 seconds of poison to the enemy
### Explodificator
A netherite axe with AoE simillar to sculk maul, however there is an added effect of causing a pushback effect simillar to the geyser trap. The pushpack should affect both players and monsters. Its like a worse sculk maul.
## Ranged
Ranged weapons need arrows to function, which is a problem, if you cannot override this, just replace one of the blocked inventory slot with replenishing stack of arrows.

# Enemies
Dont add the enemies to existing level types, I will do that manually.
### Old bones
A weak 5 hp skeleton with a netherite sword.
### Brooding Mother
A spider with scale 0.45 so it can fit into 1 block doors. It is quite slow and tanky (30 hp).

### Spiderling
A small spider (0.25 scale) with 1 hp and low damage.

A zombie kited in netherite armor, no weapon. It has 10 hp, when killed, it leaves behind a primed tnt (not a real tnt, we dont want to destroy the level). The tnt beeps and explodes after 3 seconds.
### Bedrock Walker
A husk in netherite armor. It is incredibly slow, packs a mean punch and has 60hp.

# Modifiers
## More enemy hp
- Makes it so health of the enemies is multiplied by 1.3 (multiple modifiers stack multiplicatively)
## Less enemy hp
- Same as more enemy hp, but instead it is multiplied by 0.7
## Trap modifiers
- Add modifiers for the 3 new traps, unique for their respective level, they work like other trap modifiers do.
